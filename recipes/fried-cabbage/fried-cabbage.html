        <h2>About the Recipe:</h2>
        <p>Fried cabbage is one hearty and flavorful side dish. Cabbage is sautéed until buttery tender, then mixed with bacon, stone ground mustard, and smoked paprika for an irresistible sweet, savory, and smoky flavor.</p>
        <p>Let me forewarn you, this recipe is highly addictive! Fried cabbage is a twist on my sautéed cabbage recipe — but 10x better (in my opinion) thanks to crispy bacon, savory mustard, and a dash of smoked paprika!</p>
        <p>Fried cabbage is a much-loved Southern recipe, and for good reason. A few simple, budget-friendly ingredients create one wow-worthy side dish. Serve it up alongside my creamy Cajun chicken or really any comfort food main. It’s also a welcome addition to any St. Patrick’s Day menu, where cabbage recipes take centerstage!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cabbage:</strong> You can use any colored cabbage, but I always opt for green.</li>
            <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> A few strips of bacon make everything taste better.</li>
            <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> All you need are onion and garlic to lend a savory aroma.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> I’m using stone ground mustard for a full-bodied flavor, but you can also use Dijon mustard. Then a hint of smoked paprika adds a bit of a kick!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How you'll make it:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the bacon.</strong> Heat a large pan over medium heat and cook the bacon until it’s perfectly crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove some bacon grease from the pan, leaving about two tablespoons.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté onion.</strong> Add the onion and sauté in the bacon grease for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the good stuff.</strong> Toss in the garlic, mustard, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper, and give it a good stir.</li>
            <li><strong>In goes the cabbage.</strong> Add the sliced cabbage and sauté everything together. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes until the cabbage becomes caramelized. Then toss the bacon bits back in!</li>
        </ol>
