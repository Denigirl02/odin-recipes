                <h2>About the Recipe:</h2>
                <p>I'm pretty sure that most adults love a great homemade macaroni and cheese recipe just as much as our kids do! My kids will enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni and day, but everyone gets especially excited when I make this homemade mac and cheese, and for good reason!</p>
                <p>This recipe is incredibly easy, and your kids would probably love to help you make it! I let my littles help grate the cheese and measure the noodles. For me, mac and cheese has to have a smooth and creamy cheese sauce, and I’ve had enough trial and error in this department to understand that there are a few simple things you can do to achieve that smooth sauce we all want in our macaroni!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elbow macaroni:</strong> It's my favorite for this recipe, but any other bite-sized pasta will work.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong> salted or unsalted will work–just adjust the amount of salt you add, depending on the butter.</li>
                <li><strong>Shredded Cheddar cheese: </strong>the higher quality ahed-cheddar, the better!</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Half and half</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How you'll make it:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven.</strong> Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the macaroni.</strong> Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the roux.</strong>  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Add milk and cheese.</strong>  Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Pour into baking dish.</strong>  Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
            </ol>
