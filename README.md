# odin-recipes

## The Project

This project is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I will create a small very basic website in which four recipies I really want to try out are listed. 

After I am done with this project I will have demonstrated basic knowledge of HTML. I will know how to do basic formatting, link absolute websites and relative files and create a folder structure that is as organized as possible.


## Reflection after Project

I'm now done, and I am very proud of what I have made. I learned a few things that seem to be really important for the future, which I will touch on in a little bit.

I decided to add two easy and two a bit more complicated recipes. I found that having code that is easy to read is extremely important. In all the lists and paragraphs, you can get easily lost if you dont make an effort to make it readable.
I decided to make every image the same width to keep consitency between recipe pages, and I think it came out really nice!
I also decided to link the source of the recipe on the bottom of the page, as I think if anyone actually likes making any of the recipe's the original websites with imaged instructions is going to be a better source work from!
I'm very much looking forward to the next assignment. This one wasn't anything particularly difficuilt, but it was nice to do something instead of reading a lot. I hope it keeps going back and forth.

## Important things I learned

I quickly found out that writing tags around copied text is very tedious. I thought to myself that it would be easier if I could just select the text, and wrap the selected text with tags. I googled a bit and stumbled across [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44480051/wrapping-a-html-element-in-visual-studio-code-using-emmet/44556731#44556731) on Stackoverflow, mentioning how to use **Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation**. 
I think this easily cut down the time I worked on this project by 10 minutes if not more, and had me use my mouse less which seems much more efficent. 
This is going to be something I'll keep using going forward!
