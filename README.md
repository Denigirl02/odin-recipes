# odin-recipes

## The Project

This project is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I will create a small very basic website in which four recipies I really want to try out are listed. 

After I am done with this project I will have demonstrated basic knowledge of HTML. I will know how to do basic formatting, link absolute websites and relative files and create a folder structure that is as organized as possible.


## Reflection after Project

coming soon...
